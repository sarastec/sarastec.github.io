                    My name is Sara Stec and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences,
                    seeking an internship in the IT field. I'm especially interested in longer-term collaboration opportunites.

                    The programming languages I am most proficient in are C# and Python. I am particularly passionate about object-oriented and low-level programming.
                    I am an analytical thinker who enjoys acquiring knowledge and learns quickly.
                    I also enjoy website and UI design.
                    I strive to utilize my existing skills as well as gain entirely new knowledge at any opportunity.

                    In my free time, I read mystery books and play games, mainly jRPGs and puzzle games.
                    I also enjoy knitting and crocheting.
                    Besides mathematics and computer science, my greatest passion is music â€” my favorite instrument is the piano, which I have been playing for eight years.
